# Spec profile: example

<!-- One per project, at most about 60 lines. The front matter is for the scripts: flat key: value lines, and no # inside a value, because # starts a comment. The prose below is for agents. -->
<!-- Never put personal data, company hosts or credentials here. They go in environment_file, which stays out of git. -->
<!-- The scripts find this file by walking up from the spec folder, then from the current folder. At each level they check spec-profile.md, specs/spec-profile.md and docs/specs/spec-profile.md. Pass --profile when spec_home is outside the project and you run a script from elsewhere. -->

## Rules to honour (pointers, not copies)
<!-- Where the project's own rules live. Intake turns the ones a change touches into constraints in intent.md. Never copy the rules here. -->
- api: CLAUDE.md, all sections.
- web: AGENTS.md, sections "Testing" and "Logging".

## Human-only actions
<!-- Actions the executor never takes. A check that needs a device, a login or credentials goes here, not in preflight. -->
- Merge a PR, mark it ready, promote between branches.
- Any check that needs a signed-in browser, a physical device or production access.
- Release signing and anything that touches a secret.

## Notes
<!-- What intake and handoff need: PR template paths, worktree and branch conventions, release order between repos. -->
- PR templates: api .github/pull_request_template.md; web .github/pull_request_template.md.
- Worktrees: a folder per spec beside the primary checkout; branch feature/<spec>. Never switch the primary checkout.
- Release order: web before api when both change.
