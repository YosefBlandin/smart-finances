# Web UI: design system and screens: review

<!-- Tables only. Scripts check what can be checked; reviewers judge the rest. No numeric scores and no self-grading: every reviewer is a fresh context, ideally on a different model. M tier adds this file with new-spec.mjs --add review.md when it first needs it. Examples sit in these comments. -->

## Lens review
<!-- At G-design. One fresh reviewer per lens: security and data; contract and deploy; pre-mortem (states and exits); frontend when there is a web or app UI PR. Reviewers report only correctness or requirement gaps, with evidence. Rows have no ids; cite the AC or decision a finding touches. Severity: blocker, major or minor. Disposition: accepted (what changed, where) or rejected (why, with evidence). Example row: | contract and deploy | major | Reads would still write an event per call if the old logger stays on. | D-1 | architecture.md Components | accepted: the logger skips reads; a test checks it | -->
| Lens | Severity | Finding | Cites | Evidence | Disposition |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## Cold-read log
<!-- At G-handoff, one run per brief and round: a fresh context on a cheaper or different model gets only intent.md, the brief and the sections it cites (tier S: spec.md). Model class is cheaper, different, or same in a fresh context; never a model name. Gate: zero cannot-start items. -->
| Brief | Round | Date | Model class | Cannot start | Missing values | Assumptions | Fixed in |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## Conformance review
<!-- Before each draft PR: a fresh reviewer compares the diff with the brief and its test ids. A finding that needs a decision becomes a deviation, not an edit. -->
| Brief | Date | Tasks matched | Test ids found | Off-brief changes | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## Outcome
<!-- At G-close. One line per AC: pass, fail or partial, and where it was verified, for example: - AC-1: pass, T-E2E-1 on production. Then the merge sha per repo. -->

## Defects
<!-- Every defect found after G-handoff. Origin: spec-gap (the spec was silent), spec-wrong (the spec was wrong), executor (the brief was right, the code was not), env (tools, access, CI). -->
| Defect | Origin | Found at | Fixed in | Kit change |
|---|---|---|---|---|

## Metrics
| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Decision point minutes (DP1, DP2, DP3, DP4) | |
| Decision rounds after G-design | |
| Lens findings, and the share rejected (%) | |
| Cold-read cannot-start items, per round | |
| Deviations | |
| Folder tokens; executor required reading (status.mjs) | |

## Kit changes
<!-- Each recurring issue becomes a lint rule or a template change in agent-kit. One line each, naming the defect or metric behind it. -->
